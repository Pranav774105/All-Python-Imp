Class-Based API's :
		Rest Framework APIView class is a subclass of Django's View Class.

		APIView is different than Django's View Class.

		In Django View, we can define the handler methods for get and post requests. In APIView of rest_framework
		we can define the handler methods like get, post, put, patch, and delete.


		How to create class-based API in the django rest framework


		from rest_framework.views import APIView
		from rest_framework.response import Response


		class SecondAPI(APIView):
			def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
				"Bussiness Logic for get method"
				return Response(data,status)


		urls.py -> app level urls.py file
		from app_name.views import SecondAPI
		urlpatterns = [
			path('second/', SecondAPI.as_view()),
		]
