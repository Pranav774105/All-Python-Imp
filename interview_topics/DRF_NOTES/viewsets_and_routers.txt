ViewSets and Routers:
		Django Rest Framework provides us the functionality to combine the logic of related views into single class.
		Combining logic of related views into single class is ViewSet.

		ViewSets doesn't provides any handler methods for your class like .get() or .post() but instead of that it
		provides us the methods like .list(), .create(), .retrieve(), .update(), .partial_update(), destroy().

		We can create endpoints for ViewSets by using Routers.

		Routers:
			Routers provides you the functionality to create endpoints for your ViewSets.
			Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resourceful controller.
			Instead of declaring separate routes for your index... a resourceful route declares them in a single line 
			of code.
			
			1. SimpleRouter:
				This router includes routes for the standard set of list, create, retrieve, update, partial_update 
				and destroy actions.



				project level urls.py
				from rest_framework.routers import SimpleRouter
				from app_name.views import ViewSet
				router = SimpleRouter()
				router.register('prefix',ViewSet,basename='prefix') # basename is mandatory
				urlpatterns = [
						....,
						path('api/',include(router.urls)),
				]

			2. DefaultRouter:
				This router is similar to SimpleRouter as above, but additionally includes a default API root url, 
				that returns a response containing hyperlinks to all the list action of ViewSet. It also generates routes for 
				optional .json style format suffixes.

				
				project level urls.py
				from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
				from app_name.views import ViewSet
				router = DefaultRouter()
				router.register('prefix',ViewSet,basename='prefix') 
				urlpatterns = [
						....,
						path('api/',include(router.urls)),
				]
			
			There are 2 mandatory arguments to the register() method.
			1. prefix : The URL prefix to use for this set of routes.
			2. viewset : The ViewSet Class.

			Optional Parameter : you may specify an additional argument.
			basename : The base to use for the URL names that are created.
