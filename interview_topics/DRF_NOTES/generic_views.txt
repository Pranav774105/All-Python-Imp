Generic Views :-
	The generic views provided by REST framework allow you to quickly build API views that map closely to your
	database models.

		Django Rest Framework provides you some built-in generic views which you can use for building API's.
		e.g.
			ListAPIView
			CreateAPIView
			RetrieveAPIView
			UpdateAPIView
			DestroyAPIView

	Apart from these DRF also provides you some built-in generic views that provides you functionality to combine
	the logic of related methods:
			ListCreateAPIView
			RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
			RetrieveUpdateAPIView
			RetrieveDestroyAPIView

		How To Create/Design API's using generic views
		
		1. import the generics module from rest_framework
			from rest_framework import generics
	
		2. extend the generic views to design the API

			e.g to create the resource and retrieve all the resources of perticular database model 

			class PostListCreateAPIView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
				serializer_class = PostSerializer
				queryset = Post.objects.all()

	
			Note that you don't need to define any method inside your API class as generic views already take care of
			it.
			
			So the above API we just designed will create a new resource on the server as well as retrieve all the 
			resources of that perticular database model.

			Simillarly we can create API to retrieve, update or delete the resource from the server using generic view
			class RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView.

			class PostRetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
				serializer_class = PostSerializer
				queryset = Post.objects.all()

			Note that UpdateAPIView will do update as well as partial_update

		3. Create endpoints/routes/urls for the API's we have created.
