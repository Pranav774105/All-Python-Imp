Authentications and Authorization :
		Authentication - Authentication is a mechanism to check whether any user is associated with incoming request.
		
		Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In other words, it is a way of confirming that someone is who they claim to be.

		Authentication is typically performed by providing some form of information or credentials.

		Set of Credentials :- user , where this request came from or token signed with the request.

		Authorization :- Authorization means whether to allow the request or not. Permissions are used to restrict the user from accessing part or functionality of the view.

		Authorization is a process of granting or denying the access to resource or actions based on the authenticated user's identity and the permissions they have been granted. In other words, it is a process of determining whether a user has the necessary rights to access perticular resource.

		Authorization is typically done after authentication. Once the user has been authenticated , authorization can control what actions can they perform. This is done by assigning roles or permissions to users.

		Authentications and Permissions always work together.

		Authentications and Permissions are checked at the start of the view or before any other code gets executed.
