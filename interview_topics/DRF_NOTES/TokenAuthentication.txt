Token Authentication - 
	Token authentication is one of the simple token-based authentication scheme. Token Authentication is appropriate
for client-server setups, such as native desktop and mobile applications.

	To use TokenAuthentication you need to include rest_framework.authtoken in INSTALLED_APPS setting.

	INSTALLED_APPS = [
		...,
		'rest_framework.authtoken',
	]

	make sure to run the migrate command.

	Create an endpoint to generate a new token for the user or get the existing token for user.

	in project level urls.py

	from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
	
	urlpatterns = [
		...,
		path('token/', obtain_auth_token),
	]

	After creating the api's you can use tokenauthentication to restrict unauthenticated user from accessing the api 
	or part of an api

	To use tokenauthentication for any perticular api
	in views.py
	from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication
	from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

	class BlogViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
		serializer_class = BlogSerializer
		queryset = Blog.objects.all()
		authetication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]
		permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
