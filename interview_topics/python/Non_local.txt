To modify x in the enclosing scope from inside g(), you need the analogous keyword nonlocal. 
Names specified after the nonlocal keyword refer to variables in the nearest enclosing scope:

>>> def f():
...     x = 20
...
...     def g():
...         nonlocal x
...         x = 40
...
...     g()
...     print(x)
...

>>> f()
40

global will change value of global but not in enclosing scope
to change value in enclosing scope do use nonlocal keyword
