immutablity:
once we create an object we cant perform any changes if we try to 
perform any changes with those changes new object will get created

a = 10
b = 10
both a and b shares same memory loaction as all fundamental datatypes 
are immutable in nature

l = [1, 2, 3]
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l and l1 have differnt memory locations as list is an mutable ds

== meant for content comparison
is meant for address comparison
