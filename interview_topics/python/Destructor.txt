Destructors are called when an object gets destroyed.
In Python, destructors are not needed as much as in C++ 

because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically. 
The __del__() method is a known as a destructor method in Python. 
It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected. 

class A:
    def __del__(self):
        print('Deleted')
def foo():
    print('Foo')
    a = A()
foo()

a = A()
del a
print(a)
