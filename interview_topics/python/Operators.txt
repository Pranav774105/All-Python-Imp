**	Exponentiation		
//	Floor division

Assignment operators

/=		
%=		
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3

>>=		
<<=

Comparison operators
==	Equal		
!=	Not equal		
>	Greater than		
<	Less than		
>=	Greater than or equal to		
<=	Less than or equal to


Logical operators
and 	Returns True if both statements are true		
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true		
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

Identity operators
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object		
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object

Membership operators
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object		
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

Bitwise operators
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
 ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
