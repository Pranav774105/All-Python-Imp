1.Creation:
list = []
tuple = () parenthesis are not necessary in case of tuple --> 1, 2, 3

2.Mutability

list --> mutable
tuple --> immutable

3.Memory Consumption
print([1, 2, 3].__sizeof__()) --> more
print((1, 2, 3).__sizeof__()) --> less

4.Comprehension
list support comrehension
tuple do not


Tuples are faster than list
we store such data in tuple that we are never going to change
for ex. ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')  --> vowels
