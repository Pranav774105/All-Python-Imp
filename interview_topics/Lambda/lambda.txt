What are Python lambda expression/lambda function/anonymous function.

	Python lambda expressions allow you to define anonymous functions.
	Anonymous functions are functions without names. 
	The anonymous functions are useful when you need to use them once or for a short period of time.

A lambda expression typically contains one or more arguments, but it can have only one expression.

syntax:

lambda parameters: expression
The expression is executed and the result is returned:
