File used for permanent storage
used for small amount of data

*******************
Temparory data
l = []
##for i in range(5):
##    l.append(i)
print(l)

Types of files:
1)Binary Files:

Files having specific encoding, Binary files will be encoded in the binary format,
which can be understood only by a computer or machine.

ExamplesDocument files: .pdf, .doc, .xls etc.
Image files: .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp etc.
Video files: .mp4, .3gp, .mkv, .avi etc



2)Text Files:
Text files don’t have any specific encoding and it can be opened in normal text editor itself.

ExamplesWeb standards: html, XML, CSS, JSON etc.
Source code: c, app, js, .py, java etc.
Documents: txt, tex, RTF etc.

Operating/Processing a File in Python:
Usually we’ve to follow the following sequence while processing files in Python.

	1. Open the file.
	2. Perform the operations (Reading, Writing etc.).
	3. Close the file.

To perform these operations we’ll use many built-in functions like open(), read(),
write(), close() and many more….

Opening a File:
When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by
invoking the open(), a built-in function.
open() has a single required argument that is the path to the file.
open() returns, the file object, usually called as “handle”.
Note: Always make sure that an open file is closed properly.


******************************************************************************
open() The open() function is used to open file.

r --> is default mode -- File not found Error if file is not there can read only
	read() Reads file and return one big string.
	read(n) Reads ‘n’ characters from the file till end of the file
	readline() Reads file and return one line at a time.
	readlines() Reads file and returns a list of lines.
	readable() Returns true if the file is readable
	writable() Returns true if the file is writable
	
w --> overwrite data if file available else will create new file can write only
	write() Writes a string data to a file.
	writelines() Writes a list of strings.
	
a --> can only append(write) and cant seek and read data as not readable only writable
		
close() Closes file & free up system resources.
	This is critical because if the file is not closed properly, it can be corrupted or not available to other parts of the program. 
	Data loss is not acceptable, so we need to ensure that no matter what the file is closed when we’re done with it.
