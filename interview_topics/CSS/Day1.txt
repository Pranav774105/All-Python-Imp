What is CSS?
	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
	CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

Why is it called cascading in CSS?
	The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.
	So, if you set the color of the body text to "red", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will 
	also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
