Uploading images in Django

settings.py 

MEDIA_ROOT =  'media'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'


MEDIA_ROOT is for server path to store files in the computer.
MEDIA_URL is the reference URL for the browser to access the files over Http.

 









In the urls.py(project_level) we should edit the configuration like this


from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
if settings.DEBUG:
        urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,
                              document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)


















A sample models.py should be like this,

in that we have created a Car model which consists of car name and its image. 
In this project we are taking the  Brand Name and its image from the user. 



# models.py
 class Car(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    car_img = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/')



Here upload_to will specify, to which directory the images should reside,
by default django creates the directory under media directory which will 
be automatically created when we upload an image.











we are dealing with model form to make content easier to understand.

# forms.py

from django import forms
from .models import Car
 
 
class CarForm(forms.ModelForm):
 
    class Meta:
        model = Car
        fields = ['name', 'car_img']















we have to create a html file for uploading the images.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Car_image</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form method = "post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>











from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import CarForm
from .models import Car




# Create your views here.
 
 
def car_image_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = CarForm(request.POST, request.FILES)

        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('success')
    else:
        form = CarForm()
    return render(request, 'demo1.html', {'form': form})


def success(request):
    return HttpResponse('successfully uploaded')





whenever the car_image_view hits and that request is POST, 
we are creating an instance of model form form = CarForm(request.POST, request.FILES) 
image will be stored under request.FILES one. If it is valid save into the database 
and redirects to success url which indicates successful uploading of the image.












from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from .views import car_image_view, success
 
urlpatterns = [
    path('image_upload', car_image_view, name='image_upload'),
    path('success', success, name='success'),
]










Now make the migrations and run the server

submit form

Now in the project directory media directory will be created,
an images directory will be created and the image will be stored under it. 



Now we can write a view for accessing those images









def display_car_images(request):
        # getting all the objects of hotel.
        cars = Car.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'demo2.html', {'car_images': cars})








<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Car Images</title>

</head>
<body>

	{% for car1 in car_images %}
			<div>
					{{ car1.name }}
					<img src="{{ car1.car_img.url }}" style="width: 150px;" />
			</div>
	{% endfor %}

</body>
</html>

Insert the url path in the urls.py file

# urls.py
path('car_images/', car_images, name = 'car_images'),
