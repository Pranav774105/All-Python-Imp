Exercise 1: Add a list of elements to a set
sample_set = {"Yellow", "Orange", "Black"}
sample_list = ["Blue", "Green", "Red"]


Expected output:
Note: Set is unordered.
{'Green', 'Yellow', 'Black', 'Orange', 'Red', 'Blue'}

***********************************

Exercise 2: Return a new set of identical items from two sets
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{40, 50, 30}

************************************

Exercise 3: Get Only unique items from two sets
Write a Python program to return a new set with unique items from both sets by removing duplicates.

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{70, 40, 10, 50, 20, 60, 30}

*************************************

4. Update the first set with items that donâ€™t exist in the second set
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30}
set2 = {20, 40, 50}
Expected output:

set1 {10, 30}


***********************************

Exercise 5: Remove items from the set at once
Write a Python program to remove items 10, 20, 30 from the following set at once.

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

Expected output:

{40, 50}

**********************************

Exercise 6: Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{20, 70, 10, 60}

***********************************

Exercise 7: Check if two sets have any elements in common. If yes, display the common elements
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {60, 70, 80, 90, 10}

Expected output:

Two sets have items in common
{10}

**********************************

Exercise 8: Update set1 by adding items from set2, except common items
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{70, 10, 20, 60}


***********************************
Remove items from set1 that are not common to both set1 and set2

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{40, 50, 30}
